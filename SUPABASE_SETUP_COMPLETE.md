# Supabase Integration Setup Complete

## What has been configured:

### 1. Environment Variables (.env)
- Added Supabase URL and anonymous key
- These credentials are now available to the app

### 2. Database Schema (supabase-schema.sql)
Created complete database schema with:
- **profiles** table: User profile information
- **user_settings** table: User preferences and notification settings
- **check_ins** table: Daily mood/stress/energy check-ins
- **journal_entries** table: User journal entries with different types
- **activity_sessions** table: Breathing/meditation/exercise sessions

All tables include:
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Proper indexes for performance
- Foreign key relationships
- Automatic timestamp updates

### 3. Authentication System
- **AuthContext**: Manages user authentication state
- **AuthGuard**: Protects routes and redirects based on auth status
- **Auth pages**: Login, signup, and forgot password screens
- Automatic profile and settings creation on signup

### 4. Backend Integration (tRPC + Supabase)
Updated all major components to use the backend:

#### **Journal Page** (`app/(tabs)/journal.tsx`)
- Uses `trpc.journal.getEntries` for fetching entries
- Uses `trpc.journal.getCounts` for filter bar counts
- Uses `trpc.journal.create/update/delete` mutations
- Real-time updates with automatic refetching

#### **Dashboard** (`app/(tabs)/dashboard.tsx`)
- Uses `trpc.user.getProfile` for user data
- Uses `trpc.checkIns.getAll` for check-in data
- Uses `trpc.journal.getEntries` for journal data
- Calculates wellbeing scores and insights from real data

#### **Home Screen** (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`)
- Uses `trpc.user.getProfile` for user profile
- Uses `trpc.checkIns.getToday` for today's check-ins
- Uses `trpc.journal.getEntries` for journal entries
- Real-time daily score and streak calculations

#### **QuickCheckInModal** (`components/QuickCheckInModal.tsx`)
- Uses `trpc.checkIns.create` for saving check-ins
- Uses `trpc.journal.create` for saving notes as journal entries
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### 5. Database Tables Structure

#### profiles
- User profile information (name, streak, premium status, theme, etc.)
- Linked to auth.users via user_id

#### check_ins
- Daily mood, stress, energy ratings (1-5 scale)
- Time slots: morning, afternoon, evening, night
- Optional notes

#### journal_entries
- Different types: positive, negative, gratitude, reflection, free
- Title, content, mood rating
- Tags and metadata support
- 24-hour edit window logic

#### user_settings
- Notification preferences for each time slot
- Wellbeing thresholds and settings
- Heavy card display tracking

#### activity_sessions
- Breathing, meditation, exercise tracking
- Duration and completion status
- Post-activity mood/stress ratings

## Next Steps:

### 1. Run the SQL Schema
Execute the `supabase-schema.sql` file in your Supabase dashboard:
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
4. Run the query to create all tables and policies

### 2. Test Authentication
- The app will now redirect to login screen for unauthenticated users
- Sign up creates a new user with profile and settings
- All data is user-specific with RLS protection

### 3. Verify Data Flow
- Check-ins save to the database and appear in dashboard charts
- Journal entries save with proper filtering and counts
- All CRUD operations work with real-time updates

### 4. Features Now Working with Backend:
✅ User authentication and profiles
✅ Daily check-ins with mood/stress/energy tracking
✅ Journal entries with filtering and search
✅ Dashboard with real wellbeing data
✅ Entry editing with 24-hour time limit
✅ Real-time data updates across all screens
✅ Proper error handling and loading states

The app is now fully functional with Supabase backend integration!
